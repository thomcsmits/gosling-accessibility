# Accessibility in Gosling.js

The goal of this repo is to improve accessibility of [Gosling.js](https://github.com/gosling-lang/gosling.js/). One effort to improve accessibility is by adding textual descriptions to visuals, which can be used by screen readers. This repo makes an effort to extract these descriptions automatically.
