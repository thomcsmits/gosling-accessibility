## Example 1


### Visual
Here is the visual itself:

![Gosling figure displaying three charts with different visual encodings of expression of four samples accross genom](visuals/Example1_visual_encoding.PNG)

**Figure 1:** Example Gosling figure displaying visual encodings


### Automatic description
The automatically generated description: 

> Long description: Gosling figure with title: 'Visual Encoding'. The subtitle reads: 'Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods'. There are 3 subfigures. Subfigure 0 shows a plot marked with rect. The genomic field 'start' is shown on the x-axis. The genomic field 'end' is shown on the xe-axis. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row-axis. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the color-axis.
 Subfigure 1 shows a plot marked with bar. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row-axis. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the color-axis.
 Subfigure 2 shows a plot marked with line. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row-axis. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the color-axis.



## Example 2


### Visual
Here is the visual itself:

![Gosling figure displaying bar chart of expression accross genome](visuals/Example2_simple_bar.PNG)

**Figure 2:** Example Gosling figure displaying bar chart


### Automatic description
The automatically generated description: 

> Long description: Gosling figure with title: 'Basic Marks: bar'. The subtitle reads: 'Tutorial Examples'. The figure shows a plot marked with bar. The genomic field 'start' is shown on the x-axis. The genomic field 'end' is shown on the xe-axis. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis.




## Example 3


### Visual
Here is the visual itself:

![Gosling figure displaying ideogram](visuals/Example3_simple_ideogram.PNG)

**Figure 3:** Example Gosling figure displaying ideogram


### Automatic description
The automatically generated description: 

> Long description: Gosling figure with title: 'Basic Marks: Rect'. The subtitle reads: 'Tutorial Examples'. The figure shows a plot marked with rect. The nominal field 'Stain' is shown on the color-axis. The genomic field 'chromStart' is shown on the x-axis. The genomic field 'chromEnd' is shown on the xe-axis.




## Example 4


### Visual
Here is the visual itself:

![Gosling figure displaying bar chart of expression accross genome with horizontal and vertical annotations](visuals/Example4_rule_mark.PNG)

**Figure 4:** Example Gosling figure displaying bar chart with annotations


### Automatic description
The automatically generated description: 

> Long description: Gosling figure with title: 'Rule Mark'. The subtitle reads: 'Annotate visualization with horizontal and vertical lines'. The figure is an overlayed plot. Gosling's automatic text generation currently doesn't support overlayed plots.
