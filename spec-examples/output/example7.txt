Description: Gosling figure with title: 'Visual Encoding'. The subtitle reads: 'Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods'. There are 4 subfigures. All subfigures are arranged vertically. The displayed genome is hg38. The x-domain shown of all subfigures is chromosome chr1 in interval (1,3000500). Subfigure 0 shows a bar chart. The 4 different samples shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row and color-axis. Legend for color is shown. Subfigure 1 shows a bar chart. The 4 different samples shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the color-axis. Legend for color is shown. Subfigure 2 shows a plot marked with point. The 4 different samples shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y and size-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row and color-axis. Legend for color is shown. Subfigure 3 shows a plot marked with point. The 4 different samples shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y and size-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the color-axis. Legend for color is shown.
