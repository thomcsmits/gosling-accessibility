Description: Gosling figure with title: 'Visual Encoding'. The subtitle reads: 'Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods'. There are 4 subfigures. The displayed genome is hg38. The x-domain shown of all subfigures is chromosome chr1 in interval (1,3000500). There are 4 categories (samples) displayed: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. Subfigure 0 (top row, on the left) shows a bar chart. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row and color-axis. Legend for color is shown. Subfigure 1 (top row, on the right of subfigure 0) shows a bar chart. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the color-axis. Legend for color is shown. Subfigure 2 (row 1, on the left) shows a plot marked with point. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y and size-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row and color-axis. Legend for color is shown. Subfigure 3 (row 1, on the right of subfigure 1) shows a plot marked with point. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y and size-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the color-axis. Legend for color is shown.
