Plot with 4 subfigures titled: 'Visual Encoding'. The subtitle reads: 'Gosling provides diverse visual encoding methods'. The displayed genome is hg38. The x-domain shown of all subfigures is chromosome chr1 in interval (1,3000500). There are 4 categories (samples) displayed: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. Subfigure 0 (top row, on the left): X-axis (top) shows genomic positions. Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with row and color. Subfigure 1 (top row, on the right of subfigure 0): X-axis (top) shows genomic positions. Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with color (legend shown). Subfigure 2 (row 1, on the left): X-axis (top) shows genomic positions. Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with row and color. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown with size and y. Subfigure 3 (row 1, on the right of subfigure 1): X-axis (top) shows genomic positions. Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown with size and y. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with color (legend shown).
