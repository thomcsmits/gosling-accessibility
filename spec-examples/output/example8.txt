Two plots (plot marked with point and plot marked with area) titled 'Expression in samples in Chromosome 1'. First plot (on the top): X-axis (top) shows genome (hg38) at chromosome chr1. Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The 4 different categories shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown with size and y. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with color (legend shown). The genome is displayed in a circular way. Second plot (on the bottom): X-axis (top) shows genome (hg38) at chromosome chr1. Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The 4 different categories shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with row and color. The genome is displayed in a circular way.
