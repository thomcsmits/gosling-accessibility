Description: Gosling figure with title: 'Expression in samples in Chromosome 1'. There are 2 subfigures. All subfigures are arranged horizontally. The displayed genome is hg38. All shown genomes are circular. The x-domain shown of all subfigures is chromosome chr1. There are 4 categories (samples) displayed: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. Subfigure 0 shows a plot marked with point. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y and size-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the color-axis. Legend for color is shown. Subfigure 1 shows a plot marked with area. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row and color-axis. Legend for color is shown.
