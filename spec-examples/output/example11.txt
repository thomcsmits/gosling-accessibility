Plot with 7 subfigures titled: 'Matrix Visualization'. The subtitle reads: 'Comparison of Micro-C and Hi-C for HFFc6 Cells'. The displayed genome is undefined. Not all data is from the same source. Sources are numbered. There are 15 categories (samples) displayed: Active TSS, Flanking Active TSS, Transcr at gene 5\' and 3\', Strong transcription, Weak transcription, Genic enhancers, Enhancers, ZNF genes & repeats, Heterochromatin, Bivalent/Poised TSS, Flanking Bivalent TSS/Enh, Bivalent Enhancer, Repressed PolyComb, Weak Repressed PolyComb and Quiescent/Low. Subfigure 0 (top row, on the left): Subfigure 1 (top row, on the right of subfigure 0): Subfigure 2 (row 1, on the right of subfigure 1): Data is from source 1. X-axis (axis not shown) shows genomic intervals. Y-axis (axis not shown) shows genomic intervals. The quantitative field 'value' is shown with color. Subfigure 3 (row 2, on the right of subfigure 2): Data is from source 2. X-axis (axis not shown) shows genomic intervals. Y-axis (axis not shown) shows the quantitative field 'value'. Data is binned in intervals of 2048 bp. The nominal field 'category' is shown with color. Subfigure 4 (top row, on the right of subfigure 3): Subfigure 5 (row 1, on the right of subfigure 4): Data is from source 3. X-axis (axis not shown) shows genomic intervals. Y-axis (axis not shown) shows genomic intervals. The quantitative field 'value' is shown with color. Subfigure 6 (row 2, on the right of subfigure 5): Data is from source 2. X-axis (axis not shown) shows genomic intervals. Y-axis (axis not shown) shows the quantitative field 'value'. Data is binned in intervals of 2048 bp. The nominal field 'category' is shown with color.
