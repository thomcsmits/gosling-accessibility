Description: Gosling figure with title: 'Visual Linking'. The subtitle reads: 'Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom'. There are 3 subfigures. All subfigures are arranged vertically. The displayed genome is hg38. Subfigure 0 shows a plot marked with bar. The 4 different samples shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The genomic field 'start' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The genomic field 'end' is shown on the xe-axis. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row and color-axis. Subfigure 1 shows a plot marked with bar. The 4 different samples shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The genomic field 'start' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The genomic field 'end' is shown on the xe-axis. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row and color-axis. Subfigure 2 shows a bar chart. The 4 different samples shown are: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. The genomic field 'position' is shown on the x-axis. The x-axis is shown on top side of figure. The quantitative field 'peak' is shown on the y-axis. The y-axis is shown on left side of figure. The nominal field 'sample' is shown on the row and color-axis.
