Plot with 3 subfigures titled: 'Visual Linking'. The subtitle reads: 'Change the position and range of brushes to update the detail view on the bottom'. The displayed genome is hg38. There are 4 categories (samples) displayed: sample 1, sample 2, sample 3 and sample 4. Subfigure 0 (top row, on the left): X-axis (top) shows genomic intervals (entire genome is shown). Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with row and color. The genome is displayed in a circular way. Subfigure 1 (top row, on the right of subfigure 0): X-axis (top) shows genomic intervals (entire genome is shown). Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with row and color. Subfigure 2 (row 1, on the left): X-axis (top) shows genomic positions at chromosome chr1 in interval (160000000,200000000). Y-axis (left) shows the quantitative field 'peak'. The nominal field 'sample' is shown with row and color.
